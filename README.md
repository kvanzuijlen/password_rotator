# Password rotator
This project aims to help with rotating all passwords in your password vault.
It does this by utilizing a Selenium script. Contributing is easy: write a Selenium script
to change a password for a not yet supported website and open a Pull Request.

Some websites might be supported by a, not yet implemented, generic fallback script making use
of the `/.well-known/change-password` specification proposal.
